# Welcome to our Wiki! 
This page will serve as a starting point for those that are new to computing and are looking for a central place to find foundational information about computers and how they work. There are tutorials listed below on how to use different platforms such as Github, Docker, and Ubuntu so you can dive into these platforms immediately.
## Getting Started
1. [Set up GitHub](git-github.md)
- Github, using Git, which is an open source version control software, allows individuals to work on the same project simutaneously. Github, the site you are on right now, allows teams to work together on projects and provides a web interface for Git. 
2. [Set up Ubuntu](setup-ubuntu.md)
- Ubuntu is a open source operating system that is meant to be a more user-friendly version of other desktop Linux distributions. It was created in 2004 and the word 'Ubuntu' comes from the African Nguni language and translates to "humanity to others". Its name has proven to be useful to more than just people, as Ubuntu is used for servers, cloud platforms and IoT devices. In this tutorial you will download WSL2, which will allow you to use Ubuntu on your device. 
3. [Set up Docker](about-docker.md)
- Docker is a platform that packages applications into containers, which is known as containerization (you can read more about that [here](virtualization-containerization.md). It is used mainly by individual users and only requires one server to function. 

## Other Pages (sorted in order)

[Computing Parts and Concepts](about-computers-etc.md)
- This page covers basic computer terms and componenets and explains them in an easy to understand way. It covers the basis of how computers work, which will help you understand other concepts in this wiki, such as containerization. 

[About Virtualization and Containerization](virtualization-containerization.md)
- This page covers virtualization, which in essence allows your physical computer to act as multiple separate computers. Containerization is the process of taking code and turning into in a portable unit, which are called containers. The idea of containerization started in the early 2000s, but didn't really make any headway until the creation of Docker and Kubernetes in the 2010s. 

[About the Twelve Factor App](about-12factorapp.md)
- This page covers the Twelve Factor App methodology, which is a set of principles regarding how a developer should create an application. It was created in the early 2010s in response to the transition into cloud computing, where traditional software principles did not apply. Developers from Heroku helped create the Twelve Factor App, which lists key principles that a developer should follow, its goal is to deter common mistakes that are made in the application building process, and help developers find solutions to their issues.
