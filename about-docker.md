# About Docker
## What is Docker?

Docker is a *containerization* platform.

  **Containerization**: The process of packaging source code into an executable container
  - Kubernetes is used by larger infrastructures and requires at least 3 servers to run applications
  - Docker is best for individual users and smaller infrastructures, requires only 1 server
  
  **Container**: The executable, packaged source code/software. Similar to a Virtual Machine (VM), but does not simulate an entire computer
  
  **Registry**: Stores and distributes named Docker images, organized into repositories. Repositories hold versions of an image, identified by tags
  - Docker Hub is the official, public registry, and is used by default
  
  **Image**: Similar to a snapshot for VMs, it acts as a static template for containers
  
  **Layer**: The difference between an old and new image, manually created after using <code>docker commit</code> to commit file changes
  - <code>docker commit [options/flags] CONTAINER [REPOSITORY[:TAG]]</code>
  - NOTE: images are static (you cannot edit them), so any changes made must be saved to a new image!

  **Docker Daemon**: The background process running on the OS, executing Docker tasks. Configured using the Docker Desktop settings page, or through a JSON file

  **Docker Client**: The primary way of interacting with Docker. The Client sends commands to <code>dockerd</code> (the Docker daemon)
  - Client can communicate to multiple daemons

### Why Docker?

Docker is an open-source tool that is compatible with GitHub features. While Kubernetes have greater scaling and is used for larger operations, Docker is ideal for personal use and for smaller companies and cloud infrastructures that prioritize portable workloads.

## How to Use Docker
### Setup
1. [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) for your OS
2. Test installation by running <code>docker run hello-world</code>

### Running a Container
1. <code>docker pull example-image-here</code> to pull an image from the *Docker registry*
2. <code>docker run example-image-here echo "success message here"</code> to run an image, then echo a message for user-readable feedback
   - Docker container will run and then exit very quickly, so adding a message is useful for notifying the user

## Example Docker Commands
<code>docker images</code>
- lists images on the system
  
| REPOSITORY | TAG | IMAGE ID | CREATED | VIRTUAL SIZE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

<code>docker ps</code>
- lists containers that are running
- <code>docker ps -a</code> will show all containers, including ones that have exited
  
| CONTAINER ID | IMAGE | COMMAND | CREATED | STATUS | PORTS | NAMES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
